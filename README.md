Through this project, we built a **mini-kernel** with the following features

- All Scheduling Algorithms - FCFS, SJF, Priority Scheduling, Round Robin
> For those applicable, both the pre-emptive and non pre-emtive versions have been included.
- Other basic Kernel Functionalities like About, Restart, Shutdown, help

All functionalities were implemented from scratch using _Cosmos_ and _C#_
